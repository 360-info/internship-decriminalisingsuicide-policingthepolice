# INTRODUCTION

**The greatest value of a picture is when it forces us to notice what we never expected to see**, says John W. Tukey, an American mathematician and statistician.

# AIM &amp; MOTIVATION

To support the journalism team of authors and editors with compelling visualizations to support their claims and research, or creation of an analysis via a visual related to the topic selected. 

Packages selected:

- **Decriminalizing Suicide**: Suicide caused due to abuse, loss, loneliness, depression, anxiety, etc. This results in mental health issues, hence, all suicide cases will have mental health issues but might not be true vice versa. How related are these two? Identification of suicide victims can help in reduction. What other factors affects suicide?

- **Policing the Police** : Police misconduct could be a false confession, bribery, intimidation, brutality, etc. These crimes and happenings questions the trust in police worldwide. How much trust hampering has happened over the years? And is the required action being taken against the police? What are the other issues that may affect corrupt police?

---
# METHODOLOGY

### Step 1: Creating initial visualizations, aligning with specific draft articles.

### Step 2: More relvant plots were made and shortlisted where 360themes was added.

### Step 3: Plot with corrected flaws was made for one of the short-listed plots.

##### Some of the tools used:

# DECRIMANALIZING SUICIDE

.pull-left[

&lt;img src="images/whatsapp-image-2019-01-29-at-13-46-16.jpeg" width="880" /&gt;


]

.pull-right[
- Worldwide Public Health Problem.

- Over 700,000 deaths from suicide worldwide in 2019.

- Effects on the suicide rates?

- Still 20 countries have criminalized suicide.

]

##### How did we reach the concept of Decrimanlizing Suicide?

- The British Common Law: No right to take his/her life - effected the former British colonies.

- The Christian commandment of “thou shall not kill”.

- Suicide is a sin under Sharia law, in the Islamic Tradition.

## Initial Visualizations

#### Visualization 1 

![](xaringan_presentation_files/figure-html/saving_cleaned_data-1.png)&lt;!-- --&gt;

---

.pull-left[
&lt;img src="xaringan_presentation_files/figure-html/saving_cleaned-1.png" width="90%" /&gt;
]


&lt;img src="images/rejected.jpg" width="30%" /&gt;

## Why?

- 2 data sets used fro different data sources, UNDP (HDI data) and OWID (Suicide rates).

- The HDI data has recordings from 2021 values (2020 rank) and OWID had available data only till 2019.


.content-box-yellow[

#### Visualization 2


![](xaringan_presentation_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-10-1.png)&lt;!-- --&gt;

.content-box-yellow[ 
This visualization supports the article:  
[*What a registry database should look like*](https://360info.org/what-a-suicide-registry-database-should-look-like/) and tackled the data gaps which maybe due to different factors ranging from data hampering, small sample size, inconsistencies, etc.

&lt;img src="xaringan_presentation_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-11-1.png" width="90%" /&gt;

]

&lt;img src="images/rejected.jpg" width="30%" /&gt;

Data source here: [WHO](https://www.who.int/data/gho/data/themes/mental-health/suicide-rates)

## Why?

.pull-left[

- A box plot maybe the best way to show data gaps but is not an easy-to-read plot for the public.

- All countries were not covered, only the ones with outliers have been shown.

#### Visualization 3

.content-box-yellow[ 

The suicide rates in South Asian countries are reported to be between 0.43 to 331.0 per 100,000 population, which is high compared to the world average.

]

&lt;img src="images/rejected.jpg" width="30%" /&gt;

Data source: [WHO](https://www.who.int/data/gho/data/themes/mental-health/suicide-rates)


- The interface for all articles is different, so it did not make sense to put this on one page or front page.

- Here, only Sri Lanka trend seems interesting but is inconsistent and did not relate to the article content.


.content-box-yellow[ 
The package refers to Malaysia in the article 
[*Suicide is not a crime*](https://360info.org/suicide-is-not-a-crime/), Pakistan in [*With suicide not a crime, the real work begins*](https://360info.org/with-suicide-no-longer-a-crime-the-real-work-begins/), Bangladesh in [*Suicide is a mental health issue, not a crime*](https://360info.org/suicide-is-a-mental-health-issue-not-a-crime/) and a discussion on [*India's Mental Health act*](https://360info.org/how-india-continues-to-punish-those-who-attempt-suicide/). It also highlights facts about Sri Lanka in [The alternatives that can help prevent suicide](https://360info.org/the-alternatives-which-can-help-prevent-suicide/).

]

.pull-right[

Data source: [*WHO*](https://www.who.int/data/gho/data/themes/mental-health/suicide-rates)

For the article based on: [India's Mental Health Act 2017](https://360info.org/how-india-continues-to-punish-those-who-attempt-suicide/)

### Reason for rejection:

- The author's article did not align with the results and relied more on NCRB (National Crime Records Bureau) data. So later a plot with NCRB data was made.

#### Visualization 5

.pull-left[

&lt;img src="graphs/indiamap.png" width="1600" /&gt;

&lt;img src="images/rejected.jpg" width="30%" /&gt;

]

.pull-right[

Data source: [*data.gov*](https://data.gov.in/catalog/stateut-wise-distribution-suicides-causes)

### Reason for rejection:

- There was overlapping of states in the Map and removing the overlaps, would remove data.

- 2 data sources were used, one for the rates and the other for state geometry. And because of the the "id"'s for different states in geometry data did not match with the rates data and most of the id column had to be renamed manually- not a good practice.

## Selected visualization

#### Visualization 6

Data source: [NCRB](https://ncrb.gov.in/sites/default/files/adsi_reports_previous_year/Table%202.1.pdf)

.pull-left[

&lt;img src="graphs/indiatimeseries2.png" width="1600" /&gt;
]

.pull-right[

- This plot depicts the data fro NCRB. When compared with Visualization 4 of this package, it is seen that the shape is somewhat similar but the values are lower.

- The plot was created by pdf extracting and since that process took time, it was finalized after the article was published.

# POLICING THE POLICE

.pull-left[

&lt;img src="images/CAIR-Who-is-policing-the-police-sign-1.jpg" width="1467" /&gt;

]

.pull-right[

- Mistrust of Police in African-American community.

- Police shootings in the States and Philippines .

- Lack of reporting as victims may fear retaliation or lack trust in the internal systems as well.


]

##### Some stats of police misconduct around the world.

- In the UK, about 1440 cases have been recorded within England and Wales, during 2019-2020.

- Australia has 3.4% of its complaints against police involving racism and discrimination .

- There were about 2220 police killings alone in Rio de Janerio (Brazil) in 2020 itself.

Data source: [UNODC](https://dataunodc.un.org/dp-crime-corruption-offences)

Why?

- Even though this is a legit data source, but this gives a count of 'corruption' only and does not compare with the percentage of corruption involving police.

&lt;img src="images/rejected.jpg" width="20%" /&gt;

]


 Why?

- A combination of 4 data sets have been used for this visualization, two census data for population count (common years had different values), police shootings database from Washington post, which was extracted from github and a states code data set to combine the three data sets.

## Why 

 - The article on India and Karnataka specifically were removed from draft.
 
 - The columns in the data set were unclear, as shown below:

.pull-right[



Data source : [OWID](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/trust-in-others-vs-trust-in-police)

- This graph shows that the trust in police is proportional to the GDP per capita.

- This was pretty similar to the plot shown by OWID on its website.

&lt;img src="xaringan_presentation_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-39-1.png" width="90%" /&gt;

&lt;img src="images/rejected.jpg" width="40%" /&gt;

]



Data source: [data.world](https://data.world/stabile-center/ph-drug-war#)

## Why?

- There is not information in the data set for a detailed visualization, for example, years.

- An ideal plot would have been a time series here with more no. of years.

## Why?

 - This plot has been created using a library dumbbell, which can be hard to integrate within the publishing code.

## Selected Visualization 

### Visualization 11

.pull-left[

&lt;img src="graphs/police_2.png" width="99%" /&gt;

]

#### Updating visualization 10:

Here the arrows depict as if the trust in a particular institution has fallen down, which is contradictory to the authors and the gist of the package. Also, 2017 values are lower and 2013 are higher, it seems as if the higher points are for the latest year, so it can be easily misread.
