# AIM & MOTIVATION

To support the journalism team of authors and editors with compelling visualizations to support their claims and research, or creation of an analysis via a visual related to the topic selected. 

Packages selected:

- **Decriminalizing Suicide**: Suicide caused due to abuse, loss, loneliness, depression, anxiety, etc. This results in mental health issues, hence, all suicide cases will have mental health issues but might not be true vice versa. How related are these two? Identification of suicide victims can help in reduction. What other factors affects suicide?

- **Policing the Police** : Police misconduct could be a false confession, bribery, intimidation, brutality, etc. These crimes and happenings questions the trust in police worldwide. How much trust hampering has happened over the years? And is the required action being taken against the police? What are the other issues that may affect corrupt police?

---
# METHODOLOGY

### Step 1: Creating initial visualizations, aligning with specific draft articles.

### Step 2: More relvant plots were made and shortlisted where 360themes was added.

### Step 3: Plot with corrected flaws was made for one of the short-listed plots.

##### Some of the tools used:

```{r, echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("images/Screenshot 2023-06-05 at 11.27.41 PM 1.png")
```


```{r, echo = FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

- Worldwide Public Health Problem.

- Over 700,000 deaths from suicide worldwide in 2019.

- Effects on the suicide rates?

- Still 20 countries have criminalized suicide.

]

##### How did we reach the concept of Decrimanlizing Suicide?

- The British Common Law: No right to take his/her life - effected the former British colonies.

- The Christian commandment of “thou shall not kill”.

- Suicide is a sin under Sharia law, in the Islamic Tradition.

## Initial Visualizations

#### Visualization 1 

```{r saving_cleaned_data, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.height=6, fig.width=9}
ggplot(visualization1,
       aes(
         x = reorder(Entity,-avg_rate),

  ) +

    legend.position = "bottom",
    axis.text.x = element_text(
      angle = 45,
      vjust = 0.5,
      hjust = 1
    ),
    plot.title = element_text(face = "bold")
  ) +
  labs(title = "Top 30 countries by average suicide rate (2008-2019)",
       x = substitute(paste(bold("Country"))),

       )))) +

```
]


```{r out.width = '30%', echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("images/rejected.jpg")
```

## Why?

- 2 data sets used fro different data sources, UNDP (HDI data) and OWID (Suicide rates).

- The HDI data has recordings from 2021 values (2020 rank) and OWID had vaialable data only till 2019.

.content-box-yellow[ 
This visualization supports the article:  
[*What a registry database should look like*](https://360info.org/what-a-suicide-registry-database-should-look-like/) and tackled the data gaps which maybe due to different factors ranging from data hampering, small sample size, inconsistencies, etc.

## Why?

.pull-left[

- A box plot maybe the best way to show data gaps but is not an easy-to-read plot for the public.

- All countries were not covered, only the ones with outliers have been shown.

- The interface for all articles is different, so it did not make sense to put this on one page or front page.

- Here, only Sri Lanka trend seems interesting but is inconsistent and did not relate to the article content.


.content-box-yellow[ 
The package refers to Malaysia in the article 
[*Suicide is not a crime*](https://360info.org/suicide-is-not-a-crime/), Pakistan in [*With suicide not a crime, the real work begins*](https://360info.org/with-suicide-no-longer-a-crime-the-real-work-begins/), Bangladesh in [*Suicide is a mental health issue, not a crime*](https://360info.org/suicide-is-a-mental-health-issue-not-a-crime/) and a discussion on [*India's Mental Health act*](https://360info.org/how-india-continues-to-punish-those-who-attempt-suicide/).

## Short-listed visualizations

#### Visualization 4

```{r, echo = FALSE}

```{r out.width = '20%', echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("images/rejected.jpg")

]

.pull-right[

Data source: [*WHO*](https://www.who.int/data/gho/data/themes/mental-health/suicide-rates)

For the article based on: India's Mental Health Act 2017

### Reason for rejection:

- The author's article did not align with the results and relied more on NCRB (National Crime Records Bureau) data. So later a plot with NCRB data was made.

#### Visualization 5

.pull-left[

```{r, echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("graphs/indiamap.png")
```

```{r out.width = '30%', echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("images/rejected.jpg")
```

]

.pull-right[

Data source: [*data.gov*](https://data.gov.in/catalog/stateut-wise-distribution-suicides-causes)

### Reason for rejection:

- There was overlapping of states in the Map and removing the overlaps, would remove data.

- 2 data sources were used, one for the rates and the other for state geometry. And because of the the "id"'s for different states in geometry data did not match with the rates data and most of the id column had to be renamed manually- not a good practice.

.pull-left[

```{r, echo = FALSE}

```
]

.pull-right[

- This plot depicts the data fro NCRB. When compared with Visualization 4 of this package, it is seen that the shape is somewhat similar but the values are lower.

- The plot was created by pdf extracting and since that process took time, it was finalized after the article was published.

- Mistrust of Police in African-American community.

- Police shootings in the States and Philippines .

- Lack of reporting as victims may fear retaliation or lack trust in the internal systems as well.

##### Some stats of police misconduct around the world.

- In the UK, about 1440 cases have been recorded within England and Wales, during 2019-2020.

- Australia has 3.4% of its complaints against police involving racism and discrimination .

- There were about 2220 police killings slone in Rio de Janerio (Brazil) in 2020 itself.

Data source : [OWID](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/trust-in-others-vs-trust-in-police)

- This graph shows that the trust in police is proportional to the GDP per capita.

- This was pretty similiar to the plot shown by OWID on its website.

```{r out.width = '40%', echo = FALSE}

```{r out.width = '20%', echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("images/rejected.jpg")
```

## Why?

 - This plot has been created using a library dumbbell, which can be hard to integrate within the publishing code.

#### Updating visualization 10:

Here the arrows depict as if the trust in a particular institution has fallen down, which is contradictory to the authors and the gist of the package. Also, 2017 values are lower and 2013 are higher, it seems as if the higher points are for the latest year, so it can be easily misread.
