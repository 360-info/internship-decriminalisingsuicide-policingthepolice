HEADLINE: What a suicide registry database should look like

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE)
```

Countries where suicide act changed from illegal to legal- their suicide rate increaed beacuse more reporting.

- Malaysia- 2021 changed

```{r libraries}
library(readr)
library(tidyverse)
library(readxl)
```

Data source- https://ourworldindata.org/suicide



```{r}
change <- death_rate_from_suicides_gho %>% 
  filter(Entity %in% c("Eswatini", "Lesotho")
)
ggplot(change, aes(colour=Entity, y= `Age-standardized suicide rate - Sex: both sexes`, x=Year))+
  geom_line()+
  geom_point()+
  theme_minimal()+
  ylab("Suicide rate")+
  ggtitle("Countries with questionable plot")
```

In Lesotho, in 2014 the government was changed, maybe data wasnt collected properly and thoroughly then and hence a drop?
