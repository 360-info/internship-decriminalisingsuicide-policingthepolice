abstract: "For decades, computer based reporting has been an integral part of journalism, that uses public records, databases, private and public data sources to investigate patterns, trends or even anomalies in the data collected. The integration of data analysis in the reporting industry brings challenges with it, i.e., data manipulation, wrangling, access to platforms supporting visualization reorganization, etc.(Halevy & McGregor, 2012). The aim of the project is to support the journalism team of authors and editors with compelling visualization to support their claims and research, or creation of an analysis via a visual related to the topic selected. The first package, **'Decriminalizing Suicide'** focuses on *India's Mental Health Act 2017* and opposite results are observed due to different data sources, an increase and decrease after 2017, which is discussed in the report. The second package, **'Policing he Police'** takes an angle of ________ The project uses methods of data wrangling, exploration, pdf scraping, spatial analysis and basics of functions of tidyverse, in R language and uses 'themes360info' package for the theme. The report is divided into two sections, i.e., the topics of published articles. The workflow for both starts with initial analysis for the topic, the shortlisted/selected visualizations with 360info theme added, reasons for selection or rejection of a particular visualization and the challenges faced during the process. The overall analysis shows that ____"

# Background and motivation

Suicide is a worldwide public health problem. There have been over 700,000 deaths from suicide worldwide in 2019. Overtime, there have been a no. of theories if decriminalizing suicide is a boon or a bane? Will it increase the suicide rate or decrease it? It may decrease the overall rates because then people will start talking about it openly, which will improve mental health and therefore, less suicides, or it may increase the attempt to suicide rate. According to WHO, there are still 20 countries that have criminalized suicide (World Health Organization: WHO, 2021).

```{r image2, fig.align='centre', out.width="100%", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("images/26119-gettyimages-145903640---2_source_file.jpg")
```

The British common law stated that one has no right to take his/her life as it belong to the state and this affected many former British colonies like Kenya, who still criminalize suicide, even after the colonization ended.

With the advancement of science in the 19th and 20th century, it was discovered that suicidal tendencies are caused by biological factors as well and hence, continents like Europe and North America revoked the laws reagrding crimanlizng suicide.

Firther, as the years went by, and awaremeness increased, alot of policies came into action, like Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and World Health Organization Mental Health Action Plan 2020--2030 promped various countries to decriminalize suicide

Theories like 'criminalizing suicide prevents people from reaching out for help which results in an increase in suicide rate' or 'criminalizing suicide would decrease the attempts made to suicide and hence, lower the suicide rate', are up for debates.

Suicides are are result of no. of causes, ranging from abuse victims, loss, loneliness, use of intoxicants to financial issues. All these issues result in mental breakdown and it is safe to say that all potential suicide victims go through a mental health issue, it might not be true vice versa. These mental health issues come with stress, anxiety or depression and often times are linked to suicidal feelings or behaviour and might not be the only cause of suicide. The relationship between mental health and suicides is complex.

Suicide prevention strategies are being discussed and somewhat implemented at certain regions around the world, like means restriction, mental health literacy, suicide prevention finalcial support, free psychological help and responsible media coverage. Therapy and counselling are becoming openly talked about and acknowledgment of one's mental health is the first step towards a better human health globally.

For every one completed suicide, 20 more attempts are made. Identification of potential suicide victims via these attempts can result in help-seeking and prevention of suicide but crimanlizing it, hinders the help-seeking and also results in inaccurate tracking of suicides. Also, there are data gaps in data round the world for a particular year, years or season which could be a result of no. of factors like, a change in the government, a sudden technology advancement, a low economy country, major events, etc.

These gaps need to be tackled for better tracking and hence, specific preventive measures. The causes for suicides are varied, and its tracking gaps can be because of personal or national reasons. The increase or decline in the data cannot be fully trusted, as it could be false or hampered.

Another issue is the different trusted data sources having completely different numbers for the same country and the same year. The goal fo this report is:

-   hello

-   hello 2

# Methodology, data, results and discussion

In the special report, 8 perspectives were decided to be discussed, out of which intial visualizations were created, global/generic and related to a particular article and then the '360themes' package was added to the selected ones.

## Decrimanalizing Suicide

### Initial Visualizations

#### Visualization 1: A generic visualization for the package [Decimanlizing suicide- Crimanlizing suicide only makes it worse](https://360info.org/criminalising-suicide-only-makes-it-worse/).

Data source:

-   [World wide suicide rates: Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/suicide)

-   [Human Development Index: UNDP](http://hdr.undp.org/en/composite/HDI)

HDI (Human Development Index) is a statistic composite of life expectancy, mean years of schooling, expected years of schooling and per capita income. These indicators are used to classify countries into four tiers of human development.

```{r echo=FALSE}
classification_hdi <- data.frame(
  HDI_Value_2019 = c ("0.8-1", "0.7-0.8", "0.55-0.7", "0-0.55" ),

       )))) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("#A0331C", "#1C56A0", "#4B902F", "#635A61"))
```

#### Experiment for further visualizations.

For further visualizations, a more legit data source was recommended, and hence a global suicide rates data was extracted from [World Health Organization](https://www.who.int/data/gho/data/themes/mental-health/suicide-rates) which contains global data of suicide rates from 2000 to 2019..

```{r who_data, echo=FALSE}
who_data <-read_csv("data/InitialA1/data-2.csv") %>% 
  filter(Dim1=="Both sexes") %>% 
  select(SpatialDimValueCode, Location, Period, Dim1, FactValueNumeric)
```

**Comparison of data from OWID and WHO by selecting a random country, say Australia.**

```{r, echo=FALSE}
Australia_WHO <- who_data |> 
  filter(Location=="Australia") |> 
  select(Period, FactValueNumeric) |> 
  rename(suicide_rate_WHO=FactValueNumeric,
         Year=Period)

Australia_OWID <- change |> 
  filter(Entity=="Australia") |> 
  filter(Year>1999) |> 
  select(Year, `Deaths - Self-harm - Sex: Both - Age: Age-standardized (Rate)`) |> 
  rename(suicide_rate_OWID=`Deaths - Self-harm - Sex: Both - Age: Age-standardized (Rate)`)
  
join_india <- full_join(Australia_OWID, Australia_WHO, by="Year") |> 
  group_by(Year) |> 
  arrange(desc(Year)) |> 
  head(10)

kable(join_india, caption = "Comparison of Data Sources- Australia's Suicide rate", booktabs = T) |> 
kable_styling(latex_options = c("striped", "hold_position"), font_size = 14) |> 
  column_spec(3, color = "#07034D") |> 
 column_spec(2, color = "#023707" )

```

It is observed that the WHO data values are higher than OWID values for the years 2014 and after, and lower for the years 2010-2014.

#### Visualization 2: This visualization observes data gaps and reduncies in the dataset and was to be paired up with [What a suicide database registery should look like](https://360info.org/what-a-suicide-registry-database-should-look-like/)

Data source: [Global Suicide Rates WHO](https://www.who.int/data/gho/data/themes/mental-health/suicide-rates)

Here, the objective of the visualization is to confirm significant errors in any data and why any data source cannot be fully trusted. This is done by observing outliers in the data set. *Stephen Hawkins described Outliers as a point that deviates so much from the other observations that it arises a suspicion about a different mechanism being used for its generation*(G, 1987).

These data points vary differently and could be due to no. of reasons, for example, variability in measurement, hampering of data, misreporting, under reporting, duplication, sampling errors, unusual events, human errors of recording incorrect data or miskeyed upon data entry, etc.

Outliers are highly underestimated! A small proportion of outliers can affect a simple analysis, giving rise to inflated error rates and distortions in statistical estimates and removal of these can help improve the accuracy significantly(Osborne & Overbay, 2004).

Here, initially the complete data set was observed for observing outliers, but due to it being a large data set, text overlapping and squeezed observations made the visualization hard to read, hence, countries with significant outliers were selected for visualization.

#### Visualization 3: Trend of suicide rates in South Asian countries. This could be paired with any of the article with a mention of a South Asian country, for example, Malaysia in

[*Suicide is not a crime*](https://360info.org/suicide-is-not-a-crime/), Pakistan in [*With suicide not a crime, the real work begins*](https://360info.org/with-suicide-no-longer-a-crime-the-real-work-begins/), Bangladesh in [*Suicide is a mental health issue, not a crime*](https://360info.org/suicide-is-a-mental-health-issue-not-a-crime/) and a discussion on [*India's Mental Health act*](https://360info.org/how-india-continues-to-punish-those-who-attempt-suicide/). Sri Lanka is also mentioned in [The alternatives that can help prevent suicide](https://360info.org/the-alternatives-which-can-help-prevent-suicide/).

Data source: [WHO](https://www.who.int/data/gho/data/themes/mental-health/suicide-rates)

The suicide rates in South Asian countries are reported to be between 0.43 to 331.0 per 100,000 population, which is high compared to the world average.

## Policing the Police

The visualizations here are generic and related to different aspects of 'Policing the Police', for example, 

- Corruption/bribery

- Police Shootings/Encounter/Drug Wars/ Causalities

- Trust in Police

This is because, the package publication date was in June, i.e. 2-3 weeks later than the last day of internship. The article drafts would be created in early June and hence, the visualizations are not paired to specific articles for this package.
